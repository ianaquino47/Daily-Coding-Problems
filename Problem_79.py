# This problem was asked by Facebook.

# Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

# For example, given the array [10, 5, 7], you should return true, since we can modify the 10 into a 1 to make the array non-decreasing.

# Given the array [10, 5, 1], you should return false, since we can't modify any one element to get a non-decreasing array.

    count = 0
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            if count > 0:
                return False
            if i - 1 >= 0 and i + 2 < len(lst) and lst[i] > lst[i + 2] and lst[i + 1] < lst[i - 1]:
                return False
            count += 1

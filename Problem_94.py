# This problem was asked by Google.

# Given a binary tree of integers, find the maximum path sum between two nodes. The path must go through at least one node, and does not need to go through the root.

    def helper(root):
        if root is None:
            return (float('-inf'), 0)

        left_max_sum, left_path = helper(root.left)
        right_max_sum, right_path = helper(root.right)
        # Calculates the maximum path through the root
        root_max_sum = max(0, left_path) + root.val + max(0, right_path)
        # Find the maximum path, including or excluding the root
        max_sum = max(left_max_sum, root_max_sum, right_max_sum)

        root_path = max(left_path, right_path, 0) + root.val

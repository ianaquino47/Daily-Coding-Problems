# This problem was asked by Snapchat.

# Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged.

# The input list is not necessarily ordered in any way.

# For example, given [(1, 3), (5, 8), (4, 10), (20, 25)], you should return [(1, 3), (4, 10), (20, 25)].

def merge(intervals):
    result = []
    for start, end in sorted(intervals, key=lambda i: i[0]):
        # If current interval overlaps with the previous one, combine them
        if result and start <= result[-1][1]:
            prev_start, prev_end = result[-1]
            result[-1] = (prev_start, max(end, prev_end))
        else:
            result.append((start, end))
    return result

# This problem was asked by Yelp.

# Given a mapping of digits to letters (as in a phone number), and a digit string, return all possible letters the number could represent. You can assume each valid number in the mapping is a single digit.

# For example if {“2”: [“a”, “b”, “c”], 3: [“d”, “e”, “f”], …} then “23” should return [“ad”, “ae”, “af”, “bd”, “be”, “bf”, “cd”, “ce”, “cf"].

def get_permutations(digits, mapping):
    digit = digits[0]

    if len(digits) == 1:
        return mapping[digit]

    result = []
    for char in mapping[digit]:
        for perm in get_permutations(digits[1:], mapping):
            result.append(char + perm)
    return result

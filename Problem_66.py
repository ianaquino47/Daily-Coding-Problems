# This problem was asked by Square.

# Assume you have access to a function toss_biased() which returns 0 or 1 with a probability that's not 50-50 (but also not 0-100 or 100-0). You do not know the bias of the coin.

# Write a function to simulate an unbiased coin toss.

        return True
    elif not t1 and t2:
